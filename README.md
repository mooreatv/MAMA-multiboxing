## About M.A.M.A. Multiboxing

MAMA is an open-source MultiBoxing (dual-boxing) addon with the following design goals:

- Opensource license (so if the current author gets hit by a bus, anyone else can pick it up and/or make improvements)

- High quality code

- Minimal dependencies

- Low footprint (both memory and cpu and addon chatter)

- Works with a single code base on both Wow Classic and regular (SL as of this writing)

- Let's you have dynamic teams with or without ISBoxer

**M.A.M.A.** stands for **M**ooreaTv's/minimal yet **A**wesome **M**ultiboxing **A**ssistant in reverence to grandfather of all (good) multi-boxing addons: _Jamba_ (Jafula's Awesome MultiBoxing Assistant), which also inspired the _EMA_ name.


## What does it do ?

**Right now M.A.M.A relies on my DynamicBoxer for most of the functionality**

- Let's you use DynamicBoxer without requiring ISBoxer, including fast in order invite/disband, EMA sync, etc...
  just set your window slot # in the options panel or with `/mama s N`. 

- Let's you keybind or slash command "followme" and "promoteme" (`/mama f` and `/mama l` respectively)

- Set EMA master when setting group lead (if EMA is installed and config checkbox is on)

- `/mama altogether` and keybinding to do both "follow me" and "make me lead" in one efficient command. (1 addon message).

- `/mama mount` and `/mama mount dismount` and keybindings for mounting/dismounting as a team. Note that only dismount works in classic.


_Input on feature prioritization is most welcome!_

Mama might eventually also ensure your multiboxing or dual boxing team can:

- Fly to the same place

- Accept/be on the same quests

And some convenience like

- Auto vendor/repair

- And more features per your request(s) !

Mama works well in conjunction with ISBoxer and DynamicBoxer but also with other multiboxing software or hardware
