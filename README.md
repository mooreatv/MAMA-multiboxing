## About M.A.M.A. Multiboxing

MAMA is an opensource MultiBoxing (dual-boxing) addon with the following design goals:

- Opensource license (so if the current author gets hit by a bus, anyone else can pick it up and/or make improvements)

- High quality code

- Minimal dependencies

- Low footprint (both memory and cpu and addon chatter)

- Works with a single code base on both Wow Classic and regular (BfA as of this writing)

**M.A.M.A.** stands for **M**ooreaTv's/minimal yet **A**wesome **M**ultiboxing **A**ssistant in reverence to grandfather of all (good) multi-boxing addons: _Jamba_ (Jafula's Awesome MultiBoxing Assistant), which also inspired the _EMA_ name.


## What does it do ?

**Right now M.A.M.A relies on my DynamicBoxer for most of the functionality and isn't yet very _useful_ by itself, please check it out LATER/after you see the first Released file**

_Input on feature prioritization is most welcome!_

Mama ensures your multiboxing or dual boxing team can:

- Invite your team including automatically convert to raid as needed (for more than 5 characters)

- Fly to the same place

- Accept/be on the same quests

And some convenience like

- Auto vendor/repair

- And more features per your request(s) !

Mama works well in conjunction with ISBoxer and DynamicBoxer but also with other multiboxing software or hardware
